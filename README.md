## About the Project

**Mr.Traveller** is a full-stack travel booking web application designed to simulate a real-world online travel platform.

The idea for this project was inspired by a similar system introduced during the **Internet & Web Technologies (IWT) module in Year 1 Semester 2**. Based on the knowledge and experience gained from that module, this project was independently redesigned and extended with improved architecture, validations, user experience, and admin-level business logic.

Unlike the academic version, this implementation focuses on:
- Real-world booking workflows
- Secure backend validation
- Role-based dashboards
- Data-driven admin analytics

### Key Features
- User authentication and session management
- Destination exploration with detailed views
- Hotel, resort, and villa management with amenities
- Booking system with validation and status handling
- Wishlist feature with AJAX and toast notifications
- Admin dashboard with booking and revenue charts
- Fully responsive UI for desktop and mobile

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** PHP (PDO)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Charts & Analytics:** Chart.js

This project demonstrates practical application of full-stack development concepts, database design, and real-world business logic implementation.
